  "name": "Motor Disability",
  "tone": "deliberate, effort-aware, access-conscious",
  "description": "Interaction involves effort. Small buttons, hover-only actions, and drag gestures can demand precision some users may not have. Designers should consider the experience of people with motor disabilities—including those who use adaptive tools or keyboard navigation. Clarity comes from large touch targets, reduced motion demands, and flexible input paths. Design should honor movement—because for many, it carries cost."
