Percept – Accessibility Prompt Feedback Tool

Percept helps people with disabilities and neurodivergent users get clearer, more accurate responses from AI. It reviews a prompt, identifies wording that may cause confusion, and suggests changes to improve clarity and tone. The tool supports profiles such as ADHD, screenreader, low vision, dyslexia, and motor disability, tailoring feedback to each.

Purpose and Audience
Percept is designed for anyone who wants AI output to be more usable and inclusive. It is aimed at people who face cognitive, sensory, or physical barriers that can be amplified by unclear prompts. The goal is to make the technology work for the user, not the other way around.
