# 🧠 Percept

**Percept is a profile-aware feedback tool that interprets layout logic through the lens of lived experience.**  
Built for designers and developers who value cognitive, sensory, and physical inclusion, Percept provides tonal guidance shaped by real-world use—not audits or abstractions.

---

## ✨ Why Percept?

Most accessibility tools focus on compliance.  
Percept shifts the lens toward empathy—offering human-centered feedback designed for clarity, rhythm and emotional readability.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Select a user profile:**
   - Person with ADHD  
   - Screenreader user  
   - Person with low vision  
   - Person with dyslexia  
   - Person with a motor disability  

2. **Paste HTML code into the input field**

3. **Click “Analyze” to receive profile-aware feedback**

Feedback appears as narrative guidance—structured around real interaction barriers and emotional cues, not scores or diagnostics.

## 🛠️ Built With

- Vanilla JavaScript (`addEventListener`, `includes`, `forEach`)  
- Semantic HTML and responsive CSS  
- Profile-based feedback mapping via `feedbackMap`  
- Modular logic for expanding additional profiles  
- Keyword detection using normalized input (`cleanMarkup`)

## 📘 Terminology

Percept uses **person-first language** to emphasize human experience over condition.  
This ensures respectful framing across all profiles:

- *Person with a motor disability* includes users affected by dexterity, precision or mobility constraints—including those who use assistive tools  
- *Screenreader user* highlights interaction method, not ability level  
- *Low vision* focuses on visual experience, not a fixed threshold  

Percept avoids euphemisms, diagnostic framing, and audit tone. Feedback is shaped by clarity, care, and emotional intent.

- Local storage of session input for continued refinement  
- Expanded profile dimensions and traits
